# Sandydune

I like vim's built-in desert colorscheme, but I wanted more colour.

Sandydune is a fork of desert that offers:

* gentle differentiation between different types (float vs int vs string)
* control statement colouring influenced by [codekana](http://www.codekana.com/)
* diff and patch colours inspired by [jellybeans](https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim)
* some ugly red/brown colours replaced with blues

See also an always up-to-date [preview on vimcolors](http://vimcolors.com/209/sandydune/dark).
In reality, you'll see more differentiation between numerical literals that aren't visible due to limitations in vimcolors.
